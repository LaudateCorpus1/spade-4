	<p>
		Recent advances in flow cytometry enable simultaneous single-cell
		measurement of 30+ surface and intracellular proteins. In a single
		experiment we can now measure enough markers to identify and compare
		functional immune activities across nearly all cell types in the human
		hematopoietic lineage. However, practical approaches to analyze and
		visualize data at this scale are only now becoming available. SPADE is a
		novel algorithm that organizes cells into hierarchies of related
		phenotypes, or "trees", that facilitate visualization of developmental
		lineages, identification of rare cell types, and comparison of functional
		markers across stimuli.

		CytoSPADE is a robust, modular and performant implementation of Qiu et al.'s
		SPADE, including a rich GUI implemented as a plugin for the Cytoscape Network
		Visualization platform. Explore these pages to get started with CytoSPADE, or
		learn more about the algorithm or implementation.
