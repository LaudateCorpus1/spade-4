		Recent advances in flow cytometry enable simultaneous single-cell
		measurement of 30+ surface and intracellular proteins. In a single
		experiment we can now measure enough markers to identify and compare
		functional immune activities across nearly all cell types in the human
		hematopoietic lineage. However, practical approaches to analyze and
		visualize data at this scale are only now becoming available. SPADE, described in Qiu et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology</i> 2011, is a
		novel algorithm that organizes cells into hierarchies of related
		phenotypes, or "trees", that facilitate the visualization of developmental
		lineages, identification of rare cell types, and comparison of functional
		markers across stimuli.

		CytoSPADE is a robust, modular and performant implementation of Qiu et al.'s
		SPADE algorithm, including a rich GUI implemented as a plugin for the Cytoscape Network
		Visualization platform. Explore these pages to <a href='//github.com/nolanlab/spade/wiki/GettingStarted'>get started</a> with CytoSPADE, and
		to <a href='/about.html'>learn more</a> about the SPADE algorithm, the CytoSPADE implementation and other advanced tools for working with flow cytometry data, e.g., Gemstone, developed elsewhere.
