	The SPADE algorithm was originally developed by Peng Qiu in Sylvia Plevritis'
	lab in collaboration with Garry P. Nolan's laboratory. SPADE is described in the following publications/abstracts:

	Bruggner, Michael D. Linderman, Karen Sachs, Garry P. Nolan, Sylvia K.

	Data with SPADE", <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>, in press.

	recoving the hematopoietic lineage from high-dimensional cytometry data using
	SPADE", <i>Congress of the Intl. Society for Advancement of Cytometry</i>,
	2010.

<p>
	CytoSPADE was implemented in Garry P. Nolan's Laboratory by 
	<a href='http://www.stanford.edu/~mlinderm'>Michael Linderman</a>, Erin
	Simonds, Zach Bjornson, Robert Bruggner and Ketaki Sheode. CytoSPADE is in
	wide use within the Nolan Laboratory as stand-alone tool and will soon be
	available as part of the <a href='//cytobank.org'>Cytobank</a> online flow
	cytometry platform.

<p>
	Tools for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional flow cytometry data is
	an important and vibrant area of research. The above publication has a rich
	related work section that situates SPADE in the context of other advances
	tools in this field, including probability state modeling with 
	<a href='//www.vsh.com/products/gemstone/'>Gemstone</a>, SAMSpectral 
	(<a href='//www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/403'>Zare, et al., <i>BMC Bioinformatics</i>, 2010.</a>) and many others.
