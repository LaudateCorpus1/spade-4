	The SPADE algorithm was originally developed by Peng Qiu in Sylvia Plevritis'
	lab in collaboration with Garry P. Nolan's laboratory to visualize and analyze high-dimensional flow cytometry data, and especially data collected with the CyToF mass cytometer. SPADE and its use is described in the following publications/abstracts:

	CytoSPADE was implemented in Garry P. Nolan's Laboratory by Michael Linderman, Erin
	Simonds, Zach Bjornson, Robert Bruggner and Ketaki Sheode. The SPADE
	Cytoscape plugin includes code generously supplied by 
	<a href='//cytobank.org'>Cytobank</a> under the AGPL license. SPADE is
	in wide use within the Nolan Laboratory as stand-alone tool and as part of
	the <a href='//cytobank.org'>Cytobank</a> online single-cell analysis platform.

	Tools for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional flow cytometry data is
	an important and vibrant area of research. The above publication has a rich
	related work section that situates SPADE in the context of other advances
	tools in this field, including probability state modeling with
